## Philosophy

Priority = performance & SEO.
Avoid third-party dependencies (exceptions: leaflet, react-leaflet, material-ui-icons).
For style & layout: use the integrated Material Design type system and typography/theme helpers.
Use CSS Modules because css-in-js libraries are overrated. Plain CSS can get you further than you think.

## Roadmap

1. ~~ship~~
2. Get a better designer & do a design overhaul
3. Implement a headless CMS (Sanity.io)
4. Migrate docs from gitbook so our primary domain and keywords can rank higher.
